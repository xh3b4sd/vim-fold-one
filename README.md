# vim-fold-one package

This is an [Atom](https://atom.io) package to manage folds of the first
indentation level in source code files. Movement as being realized by this
package does not make a lot of sense in every single case. Folding itself needs
to be done wisely. A little ranty but partially very valid blog post about
folding can be found here:
